This folder holds application subscriptions to be deployed to managed clusters.

Each directory represents one application subscription.
The overlays represent each group of clusters (e.g. development or production) or individual clusters
to be deployed to.

The directory structure should be like this:

.
├── application-name-1
│   ├── base
│   └── overlays
│       ├── development
│       ├── production
│       └── ...
└── application-name-2
    ├── base
    └── overlays
        ├── cluster-name-1
        ├── cluster-name-2
        └── ...
