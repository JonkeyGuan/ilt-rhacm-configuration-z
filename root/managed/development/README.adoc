This folder holds application subscriptions to be deployed to all managed clusters
with the tag `purpose: development`.

Individual application subscriptions are created by creating a folder,
adding a subscription, placementrule and application object to that folder.
The subscription should point to a folder holding the application
contents (e.g. /cluster-specific or /managed)
