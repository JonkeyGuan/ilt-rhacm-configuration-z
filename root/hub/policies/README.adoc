This folder holds common policies to be deployed. Policies always
go onto the hub cluster - and use Placement Bindings to select which
cluster they apply to.

Each policy should go into its own directory.

This directory contains common placementrules that other policies can reference - if they can also
be deployed into the namespace `acm-policy`
