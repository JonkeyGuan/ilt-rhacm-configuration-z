This folder holds applications that need per-cluster configuration.

Hub specific applications go into a special folder, *hub*, to make it obvious that they
only get deployed to the hub cluster.

Cluster specific (and that means ONLY deploying to a particular cluster, not a set of clusters with a
common label) go into the application-name-x directories with kustomizations per cluster.

Directory structure should be like this:

.
├── hub
│   ├── hub-application-name-1
│   └── ...
├── application-name-1
│   ├── base
│   └── overlays
│       ├── cluster-name-1
│       ├── cluster-name-2
│       └── ...
└── application-name-2
    ├── base
    └── overlays
        ├── cluster-name-1
        ├── cluster-name-2
        └── ...
