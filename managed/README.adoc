This folder holds common applications for managed clusters.

There may be kustomization overlays for different types of clusters (like development or production) but there should *not* be any applications that can *only* go onto
a specific cluster.

For cluster specific applications (including the hub cluster) use the /cluster-specific folder.

All applications should be in their own subdirectory with a `kustomization.yaml` file to list all components.
